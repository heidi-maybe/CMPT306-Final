## Language
Python

## Compile Files
Compile all files in both folders for best results.
Example:

`cd client `

`javac *.java `

and 

`cd server`

`javac *.java`

## Running Server
`cd server`

`java Server`

## Running Clients
`cd clients`

`java MyGUI`

Fill in the prompt boxes accordingly and press join button to connect to Server.

## Known Issues and Limitations
Clients exiting still needs to be tested to see if it is handling closing all of the connections correctly.

Server response codes are still being implemented.
